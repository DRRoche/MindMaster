# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.


## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
uricsc305@uri.edu.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

### 5. Decisions (How will they be made? Majority, consensus, other?)
Decisions will be voted on. Majority will always get to make the decision. If there is a tie between our group of 4, we will leave the decision up to a coin flip.

### 6. Attendance (What are your expectations for the frequency and type of attendance?; What are legitimate reasons for missing? What do missing members have to do to make up for missed meetings)
We as members are expected to attend classes and periodic group meetings. 
Periodic group meetings will take place on Wednesday or Friday after 3pm if members
decide a meeting is needed. We expect reasonable response time to discord messages. (within 24 hours)
Notes will be taken during meetings, so if a member is unable to attend a meeting, they can 
meet with another member to look at the notes and discuss what they missed. 



### 7. Assignments (How will assignments be made? How will the group deal with members who do not complete (or poorly complete assignments?)
Assignments will be made during meeting times and members will be able to discuss 
and distribute assignments during that time. Members are encouraged to reach out before due dates of 
assignments if they need help during assignments to ensure that assignments are able to be 
completed or completed in a satisfactory manner. Assignments that are poorly complete or 
not completed at all will then have to be redone. 

### 8. Participation (How will you communicate and share information; How will you ensure full participation of everyone? How will you honor member strengths and interests)?
We as members will use discord as the primary way to communicate and to share information. Members should attend 
every class and periodic meeting times unless of a valid reason to ensure that members will be able to participate
in all activities. Members can take note of other members' participation rate to help ensure that all members 
are actively participating in discussions and assignments. 


### 9. Meeting Times and Locations/Mediums (How will you decide on locations and times that suit all members)?
We as members will periodically meet on Wednesdays and Fridays after 3pm. We will usually meet online 
through discord, however, if needed, we can meet in person at the library around the same time. 


### 10. Agenda and Minutes /Notes (Who will take them and in what format will they be shared?) 
Amir will take notes and they will be placed in a shared google drive that is accessible by all team members. 

### 11. Promptness (What do you expect and how will you handle lateness?)
We as members are expected to arrive on time to meetings. However, if a member is going
to be late or can not attend at all, they will have to communicate that with members ahead of time. 

### 12. Conversational Courtesies (How will the team encourage and reinforce active listening, sharing of the airtime, tangents, respectful dialogue, etc )
We as members will always respect each other and actively listen to each other.
Members all have shared say in all meetings and discussions. 

### 13. Enforcement/ Feedback (How will the team enforce its own rules? How do individuals prefer to give and receive feedback?)
We as members will make sure to follow team rules. If any member is found to break the rules, 
an internal discussion will be had  and if necessary, the member will be referred to the teaching staff.
