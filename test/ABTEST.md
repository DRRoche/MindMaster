* A/B Test Name: Portrait Mode 
* User Story Number:
* Metric (from the HEART grid): User Feedback, Average Session duration, repeat logins 
* Hypothesis:
As a group, Mind Master is wondering if users would rather use landscape or portrait mode when using the app. If we change the app from portrait mode to landscape mode, then developers will see an increase in average session duraiton and a decrease in churn rate. This is because users like using the app in landscape mode rather than portrait mode 

* Experiment: To start up our experiment, we would create both versions, version A being portrait mode and version B being landscape mode. Then we would launch both versions at the same time with 50% percent of users seeing version A and the other 50% of users seeing version B. After these versions are out for 48 hours we would review the metrics. We will measure the metrics we will be using for both versions. We will measure what the average session duration is, the churn rate, and the amount of repeated logins. Average session duration is measured through the firebase dashboard, churn rate is measured by seeing if the amount of active users increases or decreases on firebase as well. Repeat logins will being tracked through thunkable with each user having data collected about them about how many times they log in.

* Variation: The variation we would like to test is if users like portrait mode or landscape mode better. We would create both variations to send out to our users. ![A/BtestingPvL](./PvL.jpg = 250x250))
