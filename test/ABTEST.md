A/B Test Name: Portrait Mode 
User Story Number:
Metric (from the HEART grid): User Feedback, Average Session duration, repeat logins 
Hypothesis:
As a group, Mind Master is wondering if users would rather use landscape or portrait mode when using the app. If we change the app from portrait mode to landscape mode, then developers will see an incrase in average session duraiton and a decrease in churn rate. This is because users like using the app in landscape mode rather than portrait mode 

Experiment: To start up our experiment, we will first measure the metrics we will be using with our "A" version, the app being in portrait mode.
